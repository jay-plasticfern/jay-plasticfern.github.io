                  <p class="text-secondary">Invaluable through the submission process for Vane and talented at finding bugs in the nooks and crannies. Thanks to their help, Vane passed PS4 submission on the first try and they were great at rolling with our irregular schedule. Given the chance, I'd hire Jay and his team in a heartbeat.</p>

                  <p class="text-secondary">Releasing your first commercial game is scary. Getting through console submission is scarier. I learned so much about proper QA and certification working with Plastic Fern, and I hope we never have to go through launching a game without them!</p>
